I am currently working on a unified framework for benchmarking imitation learning algorithms on low-cost robot arms. The arm is adapted from [Alexander Koch's design](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot), with the main difference being the addition of a wrist camera. All code and hardware will be open-sourced.
