During Summer 2024, I led a six-week, hands-on robotic manipulation course for high school students from TTIC's neighboring community. The course covered Python, robot kinematics, computer vision, and robot learning. I taught students to build their own low-cost arm (adapted from [Alexander Koch's design](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot)) and program it to pick-and-place pieces in a game of tic-tac-toe.

I am currently working on refining the course materials, including code, slides, and robot and game hardware, which will be open-sourced. Stay tuned for updates! In the meantime, here is a video of the robot in action.
