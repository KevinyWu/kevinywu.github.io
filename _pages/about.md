I graduated from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) with a 4-year joint BS/MS in Applied Math and Computer Science in June 2024. I currently work as a software engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/).

My robotics journey started in March 2024, when I joined the [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/), advised by [Prof. Matthew Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). My vision is to build robots that interact safely and intelligently with the physical world. A major challenge when building general-purpose robots is the relative lack of action-labeled robot data, especially when compared to vision and language models. My research is motivated by the question: **how can we efficiently scale robot learning without scaling robot data?**

Previously, I was a member of [ZeD Lab](https://zed.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago Medicine, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ishanu Chattopadhyay](https://scholars.uky.edu/en/persons/ishanu-chattopadhyay).

My favorite hobby is building custom [LEGO creations](/lego). I sporadically post time-lapses on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kevthebuilder), and my creations have been displayed in the LEGO House and LEGOLAND Billund! I also enjoy playing basketball, cheering on Borussia Dortmund, playing guitar and harmonica, and reading.
