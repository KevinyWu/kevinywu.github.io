I graduated from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) with a BS in [Applied Math](https://cam.uchicago.edu/) and a MS in [Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu/mpcs/) in June 2024. I currently work as a software engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) in the Boston area.

During my senior year, I was fortunate to work in the [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/), advised by [Prof. Matthew Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). My research interest lies in **robotic manipulation**, with the goal of building robots that can develop a deep understanding of the world by learning from humans and their own experiences. Thus, I am interested in **imitation learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **self-supervised learning**.

Previously, I was a member of [ZeD Lab](https://zed.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago Medicine under the guidance of [Prof. Ishanu Chattopadhyay](https://zed.uchicago.edu/people.html).

My favorite hobby is building custom [LEGO creations](https://www.flickr.com/). I'll sporadically post time-lapses on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kevthebuilder), and my creations have been displayed in the LEGO House and LEGOLAND Billund! I also enjoy playing basketball, cheering on Borussia Dortmund, playing Britpop and folk songs on guitar, and reading Kurt Vonnegut books.
