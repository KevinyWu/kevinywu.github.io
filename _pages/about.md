I graduated from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) with a BS in Applied Math and a MS in Computer Science in June 2024. I currently work as a software engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) in the Boston area.

My robotics journey started in March 2024, when I joined the [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/), advised by [Prof. Matthew Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/). My research goal is to build robots that can develop a deep understanding of the world by learning from humans and their own experiences. Thus, I am interested in **imitation learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **self-supervised learning**.

Previously, I was a member of [ZeD Lab](https://zed.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago Medicine, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ishanu Chattopadhyay](https://zed.uchicago.edu/people.html).

My favorite hobby is building custom [LEGO creations](https://www.flickr.com/). I'll sporadically post time-lapses on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kevthebuilder), and my creations have been displayed in the LEGO House and LEGOLAND Billund.

<!-- I also enjoy playing basketball, cheering on Borussia Dortmund, playing folk songs on guitar, and reading Kurt Vonnegut books. -->
